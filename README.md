# Ros_opencv

Computer vision scripts for drone camera using ROS and OpenCV.

## Getting Started

Camera stream can be used as a topic, which is the way publisher and subscriber communicate in ROS. cv_bridge converts between ROS image messages and OpenCV image representation for perception applications.

### Prerequisites


```
Python 
Robotic Operating System
OpenCV
```

### Description

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.  OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code. 

ROS (Robot Operating System) provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. ROS is licensed under an open source, BSD license.

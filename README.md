### Description

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.  OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. ROS (Robot Operating System) provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. 

Camera stream can be used as a topic, which is the way publisher and subscriber communicate in ROS. cv_bridge converts between ROS image messages and OpenCV image representation for perception applications.
